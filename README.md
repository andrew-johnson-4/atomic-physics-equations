| SI Unit | Name  | Value | Notes
|---------|-------|-------|------
| He | atomic number | 2 | number of protons
| He | mass number | 4 | number of protons + neutrons
| 1/s		  | cycle | 1 Hz  |
|	m/s     | speed of light = c | 299792458 m/s |
| /s      |	hyperfine_transition_frequency(H) | 1420405752 Hz |
| m	      | c/hyperfine_transition_frequency(H)	| 21.106114054160 cm | The hydrogen line, 21-centimeter line, or H I line[1] is the electromagnetic radiation spectral line that is created by a change in the energy state of neutral hydrogen atoms. This electromagnetic radiation has a precise frequency of 1420405751.768(2) Hz,[2] which is equivalent to the vacuum wavelength of 21.106114054160(30) cm in free space.
| m	      | wavelength(a)	| c/hyperfine_transition_frequency(a) | "larger" wavelengths are considered "below" smaller wavelengths because they are canonically measured in Hz. Also smaller wavelengths are associated with higher energies. Electromagnetic waves follow the "right-hand rule" which describes the planar nature of Electro/Magnetic radiation.
| Each orbital in an atom is characterized by a set of values of the three quantum numbers n, ℓ, and mₗ, which respectively correspond to the electron's energy, angular momentum, and an angular momentum vector component (the magnetic quantum number). | atomic orbital | <img src="/img/HydrogenLikeElectronOrbits.png" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital" style="height:6em"/> | The hydrogen-like atomic orbitals are derived from the exact solutions of the Schrödinger Equation for one electron and a nucleus, for a hydrogen-like atom. The part of the function that depends on the distance r from the nucleus has nodes (radial nodes) and decays as e−(constant × distance).
| L=mνr | angular momentum vector | | The orbital angular momentum vector of a point particle is always parallel and directly proportional to its orbital angular velocity vector ω, where the constant of proportionality depends on both the mass of the particle and its distance from origin.
| ℓ | angular momentum quantum number of orbital | s | The simple names s orbital, p orbital, d orbital, and f orbital refer to orbitals with angular momentum quantum number ℓ = 0, 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

| <img src="/img/EnergyOfAPhoton.svg" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant#Reduced_Planck_constant"/> | The energy of a photon with angular frequency ω = 2πf | f is the ordinary frequency measured in hertz | A photon is an elementary particle, the quantum of the electromagnetic field including electromagnetic radiation (such as light) and the force carrier for the electromagnetic force.
| ∂z/∂x | partial derivative | | The partial derivative of z with respect to x

| Unit | Name  | Notes
|------|-------|------
| atom state	| ground state | Lowest possible energy state
| atom state	| excited	state | Electron moved to larger orbit
| atom state	| ionized	state | Electron transitioned out of atom. A hydrogen atom, having only one electron, can be ionized only once
| atom state	| completely ionized state | All electrons are gone. More ionization is associated with higher energy. Further ionization takes more energy.
