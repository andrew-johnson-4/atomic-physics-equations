# SI Terms
| SI Unit | Name  | Value | Notes
|---------|-------|-------|------
| 1/s		  | cycle | 1 Hz  |
|	m/s     | speed of light = c | 299792458 m/s |
| /s      |	hyperfine_transition_frequency(H) | 1420405752 Hz |
| m	      | c/hyperfine_transition_frequency(H)	| 21.106114054160 cm | The hydrogen line, 21-centimeter line, or H I line[1] is the electromagnetic radiation spectral line that is created by a change in the energy state of neutral hydrogen atoms. This electromagnetic radiation has a precise frequency of 1420405751.768(2) Hz,[2] which is equivalent to the vacuum wavelength of 21.106114054160(30) cm in free space.
| m	      | wavelength(a)	| c/hyperfine_transition_frequency(a) | "larger" wavelengths are considered "below" smaller wavelengths because they are canonically measured in Hz. Electromagnetic waves follow the "right-hand rule" which describes the planar nature of Electro/Magnetic radiation.

# Spectra
| Unit | Name  | Notes
|------|-------|------
| atom state	| ground state | Lowest possible energy state
| atom state	| excited	state | Electron moved to larger orbit
| atom state	| ionized	state | Electron transitioned out of atom. A hydrogen atom, having only one electron, can be ionized only once
| atom state	| completely ionized state | All electrons are gone. More ionization is associated with higher energy. Further ionization takes more energy.
